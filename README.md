# Material Characterization in the Millimeter-Wave Frequency Band

## Project Description

This project has developed an efficient method for characterizing materials in the millimeter-wave frequency band using extraction techniques for the main electromagnetic properties, such as complex refractive index and complex relative permittivity and permeability. Since 1970, when this area of research began to gain popularity, various procedures with novel implementations were investigated to provide robust and accurate results. The main objective has been to study techniques that allow the correct measurement of a material’s most important electromagnetic properties, with a special focus on minimizing errors in the empirical measurements, which results in a more accurate estimation of the material parameters.

For this purpose, free-space measurements of the material’s S-parameters were taken using a vector network analyzer, and advanced techniques were applied to extract the complex relative permittivity and permeability correctly. This work also shows the double calibration process of the TRL and GRL system and the proposal of specific signal processing, especially in charge of correcting errors inherent in this type of measurement environment, such as reflections or standing waves in the materials. Subsequently, the consequences of various deviations in the measurements, such as misalignments between ports, rotations in the system axes, and errors in the distance between antennas or material thicknesses, are analyzed.

The method has been experimentally verified by determining the electromagnetic properties of a Teflon sample and a methacrylate sample with disparate widths for a frequency range from 10 GHz to 110 GHz, demonstrating that the results are highly accurate over the entire measured frequency spectrum. This project demonstrates that it is possible to reduce errors in the characterization of materials by taking into account different key aspects, including the general calibration of the system and the correct choice of the thicknesses of the materials to be studied. The findings indicate a good correlation between the proposed method and traditional techniques, offering higher accuracy in complex relative permittivity and permeability estimation. These results are promising for future research and applications in the material characterization in electromagnetics.
